[//]: Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

I am a graduate student in Computer Science at University of Southern California, interested in generative models and AI compliance. I study the negative societal impact of generative AI and present (temporary) solutions. Also, I work on building powerful representation for generative modeling of relational data (e.g. molecules).

I co-found and lead a [volunteering interest group](https://psyker-team.github.io/index_en.html) that works on copyright issues of generative models for images. We develop softwares and provide technical services for AI copyright lawsuits as volunteers. [E-mail us](mailto:mist202304@gmail.com) if you are interested or in need of help!
