[//]: Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

I study interpreting modern generative models, with applications in 1) addressing robustness, alignment, and ethical problems in generative models, and 2) scaling generative models to handle more complex data, such as protein structures. In the real world, I am concern about the societal impacts of Generative AI and deeply invested in helping disadvantaged groups, such as human artists, in the era of Generative AI.

I co-found and lead a [volunteering interest group](https://psyker-team.github.io/index_en.html) that works on copyright issues of generative models for images. We develop softwares and provide technical services for AI copyright lawsuits as volunteers. [E-mail us](mailto:mist202304@gmail.com) if you are interested or in need of help!
