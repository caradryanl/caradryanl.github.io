[//]: Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

I work on generative models, specifically, **1)** extending the power of LLMs over relational data and **2)** scaling generative models on protein structures. I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Jiaxuan You](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jiaxuan/) and Prof. [Ge Liu](https://www.mit.edu/~geliu/).


Beyond the academia, I am a practitioner of AI copyright. I lead a [volunteering interest group](https://psyker-team.github.io/index_en.html) that develops softwares and provides technical services for AI copyright lawsuits as volunteers. [E-mail us](mailto:mist202304@gmail.com) if you are interested!



[//]: Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
